# CoworkingSpace
The CoworkingSpace project includes three roles: Guest, Member and Administrator. As a guest, it is possible to register and then log in, which makes one a member. As a member, one has the possibility to reserve either a half or a full day in the CoworkingSpace on selected days. In addition, a member can change his user data such as first name, last name, email and password. The administrator has the authority to see which members have made a reservation request for a full or half day on which days. He can then decide whether to accept or reject the request. In addition, of course, the administrator also has the option to reserve the CoworkingSpace himself. In another view, the administrator has an overview of the members and can edit or delete them.
